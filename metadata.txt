Table S1: Available as a CSV file, provides comprehensive information on the networks utilized in the study. It includes the names of the networks, the families of pollinators involved in each network, their respective orders, and the assigned functional groups for each family. 

Table S2: Available as a CSV file, presents a detailed overview of the most attractive plant species selected based on their maximum interaction with pollinators in each matrix. It includes columns such as "FileNames" for identifying the datasets, "Species_level" indicating the plant species with the highest interactions at the species level, and "Max_interactions" specifying the number of interactions. Similar interpretations apply to other columns in the table, providing comprehensive information on the selected plant species and their interactions with pollinators across different taxonomic levels of classification.
